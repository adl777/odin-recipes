This is the first project in the foundation class of html,css and javascript  from TheOdinProject

In  this project we are building a website which will link to few recipes

This is built with what we learned before this project from TheOdinProject 

Short summary of what we have learned before this project(html)

1.Html Boilerplaite
  Setting up the html document ready to write html code

2.Paragraphs and Headings
  <p> and </p> tags are used to write paragraphs
    The paragrap tag includes the opening tag(<p>) and closing tag(</p>) 
    The content we want to write is between  in this opening and closing tags 
    
    <h1> and </h1> tags are used to write headings
    The content is written in the same way as in the case of paragraphs 
    But the difference is that  there six level of heading from <h1> to <h6>
    As the level of headings lowers the the importants of headings also lowers
    Note-Don't use heading tags to make the headings for bold and big(because it affects SEO)
    
3. the STRONG and EMPHASIZE tags
   the strong tag is used to make the text bold and mark it important.
   The emphasize tag is used to make the text italic and emphasize the text 
   To use the strong tag write the code like this - <strong> content comes here </stong>
   To use the emphasize tag write the code like this- <em> content comes here </em>
    
4. Images and Links
   Links 
   To use link write the code like this <a href="link">Click me</a>
   There are two types of links
   Absolute links- Link that links the page to another page on the web
   Relative link -Link to a page on the same website
   
   Images 
    To use  images  write the code like this <img src="path" alt="">
     There are two types of images just like the links
     
     The alt attribute is used to describe the text and to show when the image isn't loaded 
     (This can be helpful to screenreaders which helps the peoples with visual imparities)
